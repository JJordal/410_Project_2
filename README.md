# 410_Project_2

Dot Product:

Linear Interpolation: There is a slider in the bottom left of the screen that uses linear interpolation and changes the speed of the ghosts between 1 and 4.

Particle Effect: The particle effect in our project is at the GameEnding location. The particle effect makes it more clear to the player that the escape is down that hall.

Josh Jordal:

Jake Follett: Completed enemies 1 and 2 and added linear interpolation.

Cristian Ion: Completed the Camera, Ending the Game, Audio, and Particle Effect.
